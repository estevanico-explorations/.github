# Estevanico
My personal Github Organization dedicated to Explorations & Learning. 

The repositories contained herein are singularly focused on learning new concepts, technologies or exploring concepts. No repo in here is meant for production but rather exploring new ideas that I may blog or impliment elsewhere if I find it fruitful or interesting enough to share.

Please, feel free to peruse and see what you can take from it as that would be a great compliment. No repo in here will be maintained with any ferocity nor consistency.
